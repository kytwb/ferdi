## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the [Ferdi Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to [stefan@adlk.io](mailto:stefan@adlk.io).

## What should I know before I get started?
For the moment, Ferdi's development is a bit slow but all contributions are highly appreciated. [Check this issue for discussion](https://github.com/getferdi/ferdi/issues/956).

## How Can I Contribute?
As a basic rule, before filing issues, feature requests or anything else. Take a look at the issues and check if this has not already been reported by another user. If so, engage in the already existing discussion.

## Styleguide
### Git Commit Messages
* Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
* Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
* Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
* Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line
* When only changing documentation, include `[ci skip]` in the commit description

### Javascript
* Please use `es-lint` and the defined rules to maintain a consistent style
